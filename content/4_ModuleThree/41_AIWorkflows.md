# AI-Powered Development Workflows

## Transforming Development with Intelligent Automation

AI-powered development workflows represent a fundamental shift from reactive to proactive development. Instead of waiting for issues to arise, AI anticipates needs, suggests optimizations, and automates routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on creative problem-solving and innovation.

### Setting Up Your AI Development Environment

Let's configure your Coder workspace with comprehensive AI development tools.

#### Step 1: Access Your AI-Enhanced Workspace

First, create a new workspace using the AI-enhanced template we built in ModuleTwo:

```bash
# Connect to your Coder instance
coder login https://your-coder-instance.com

# Create an AI-enhanced workspace
coder create ai-dev-workspace --template="ai-enhanced-developer"

# Connect to your workspace
coder ssh ai-dev-workspace
```
#### Step 2: Initialize AI Development Tools
Once in your workspace, let's set up the AI development toolkit:
```bash
# Initialize the AI development environment
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/your-org/sample-ecommerce-app.git
cd sample-ecommerce-app

# Install AI development dependencies
npm install -g @aws/amazon-q-developer-cli
pip3 install boto3 anthropic openai

# Configure AI tools
aws configure  # Set up AWS credentials
q configure    # Configure Amazon Q Developer
```
### Workflow 1: AI-Assisted Feature Development
#### Scenario: Adding a Product Recommendation Engine
Let's walk through developing a new feature using AI assistance from start to finish.
Step 1: Requirements Analysis with AI
Start by describing your feature in natural language:
```bash
# Use Amazon Q Developer to analyze requirements
q analyze-requirements "Add a product recommendation engine that suggests related products based on user browsing history and purchase patterns. Should integrate with existing user authentication and product catalog."
```
Amazon Q will provide:
- Technical requirements breakdown
- Architecture suggestions
- Implementation approach
- Potential challenges and solutions
Step 2: AI-Generated Project Structure
```bash
# Generate project structure
q generate-structure --feature="product-recommendations" --framework="express-react"
```
This creates:
```bash
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ProductRecommendations/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ RecommendationEngine.js
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ RecommendationCard.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ RecommendationList.js
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ recommendationService.js
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Recommendation.js
â””â”€â”€ tests/
    â””â”€â”€ recommendations/
        â”œâ”€â”€ engine.test.js
        â””â”€â”€ service.test.js
```

#### Step 3: AI-Powered Code Generation
#### Step 4: AI-Generated API Endpoints
#### Step 5: Create the AI code review
