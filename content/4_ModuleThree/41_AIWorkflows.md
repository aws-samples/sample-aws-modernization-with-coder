# AI-Driven Development Workflows

## Transforming Development with Intelligent Automation

AI-driven development workflows represent a fundamental shift from reactive to proactive development. Instead of waiting for issues to arise, AI anticipates needs, suggests optimizations, and automates routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on creative problem-solving and innovation.

### Setting Up Your AI Development Environment

Let's create your Coder workspace with comprehensive AI development tools.

#### Step 1: Access Your AI-Enhanced Workspace

Create a workspace using the AWS Workshop - EC2 (Linux) Q Developer template:
1. **Access your Coder dashboard** and click "Create Workspace"
2. **Select the AWS Workshop - EC2 (Linux) Q Developer template** (created in the previous module)
3. **Configure the workspace parameters**:
   - **Name**: `linux-qdev-workspace`
   - **Instance type**: 2 vCPU, 4 GiB RAM
   - **Region**: us-east-1 (Default)
   - **Disk Size**: 30 GB (Default)

4. **Click "Create Workspace"** and wait for it to start

#### Step 2: Access Your Linux Q Developer Workspace

Once your workspace is running:

1. **Open the workspace** from your Coder dashboard
2. **Launch VS Code** or your preferred editor
3. **Open a terminal** within the workspace

#### Step 3: Initialize AI Development Tools
Once in your workspace, let's set up the AI development environment:
```bash
# Initialize the Q Developer CLI
q login    # Use for Free with Builder ID option, and follow prompts
q chat     # Initialize chat session
```
### Workflow 1: AI-Assisted Feature Development
#### Scenario: Adding a Product Recommendation Engine
Let's walk through developing a new feature using AI assistance from start to finish.
Step 1: Requirements Analysis with AI
Start by describing your feature in natural language:
```bash
# Use Amazon Q Developer to analyze requirements
analyze the following requirements: "Add a product recommendation engine that suggests related products based on user browsing history and purchase patterns. Should integrate with existing user authentication and product catalog."
```
Amazon Q will provide:
- Technical requirements breakdown
- Architecture suggestions
- Implementation approach
- Potential challenges and solutions
Step 2: AI-Generated Project Structure
```bash
# Generate project structure
q generate-structure --feature="product-recommendations" --framework="express-react"
```
This creates:
```bash
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ProductRecommendations/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ RecommendationEngine.js
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ RecommendationCard.js
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ RecommendationList.js
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ recommendationService.js
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Recommendation.js
â””â”€â”€ tests/
    â””â”€â”€ recommendations/
        â”œâ”€â”€ engine.test.js
        â””â”€â”€ service.test.js
```

#### Step 3: AI-Powered Code Generation
#### Step 4: AI-Generated API Endpoints
#### Step 5: Create the AI code review
