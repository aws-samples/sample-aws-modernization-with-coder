# AWS and Coder AI-Powered Development Workshop

![Partner Logo][coder-log-def]

## Welcome to the Future of Development

Welcome to the AWS and Coder AI-Powered Development Workshop â€“ your gateway to transforming developer productivity through cloud-native development environments enhanced with artificial intelligence. This hands-on workshop demonstrates how to eliminate development friction while supercharging coding workflows with AI assistance.

## The Developer Experience Revolution

Imagine a world where:
- **New developers are productive in minutes, not days** â€“ No more "it works on my machine" or lengthy environment setup
- **AI becomes your coding partner** â€“ Amazon Q Developer and Anthropic Claude Code provide intelligent code suggestions, reviews, and documentation
- **Security is built-in, not bolted-on** â€“ Centralized, compliant cloud development environments with audit trails
- **Resources scale automatically** â€“ Pay only for what you use with intelligent capacity management
- **Teams collaborate seamlessly** â€“ Shared cloud development environment templates ensure consistency across projects

This isn't a vision of the future â€“ it's what you'll build today.

## Key Learning Objectives (Duration 90 minutes)

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to demonstrate new skills in the following areas:

**Infrastructure & Platform Management:**
- Deploy and configure a production-ready Coder platform on Amazon EKS
- Understand the architecture patterns for scalable cloud development environments
- Implement secure, multi-tenant development infrastructure using AWS best practices

**Template Creation & Management:**
- Create persona-based Coder templates for different development environments (General/Linux, Serverless, AI-Assisted, Windows)
- Configure templates with pre-installed tools and dependencies
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) patterns for consistent workspace provisioning

**AI-Powered Development Workflows:**
- Integrate Amazon Q Developer for intelligent code assistance and generation
- Leverage AWS Bedrock with Anthropic Claude Code for advanced code review and documentation
- Create agentic development workflows that automate repetitive tasks

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- Onboard developers in minutes instead of days
- Standardize development environments across teams
- Implement secure development practices with built-in compliance
- Scale development capacity dynamically based on project needs

## What Makes This Workshop Unique

**Real-World Impact**: Based on production deployments serving thousands of developers at enterprise scale

**AI-First Approach**: Deep integration with Amazon Q Developer and AWS Bedrock for intelligent development workflows

**Production-Ready Architecture**: Enterprise-grade security, scalability, and cost optimization built-in

**Hands-On Learning**: Deploy, configure, and use the platform â€“ not just theory

## Who Should Attend

- **Platform Engineers** building developer experience platforms
- **DevOps Engineers** implementing cloud-native workflows
- **Engineering Managers** seeking to boost team productivity
- **Developers** interested in AI-enhanced development
- **Solutions Architects** designing scalable development infrastructure

**Prerequisites**: 200-level AWS knowledge, basic Kubernetes familiarity

## Ready to Transform Development?

The future of software development is cloud-native, AI-enhanced, and incredibly productive. Let's build it together.
