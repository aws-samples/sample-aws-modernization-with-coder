# AWS and Coder AI-Powered Development Workshop

![Partner Logo][coder-log-def]

## Welcome to the Future of Development

Welcome to the AWS and Coder AI-Powered Development Workshop â€“ your gateway to transforming developer productivity through cloud-native development environments enhanced with artificial intelligence. This hands-on workshop demonstrates how to eliminate development friction while supercharging coding workflows with AI assistance.

## The Developer Experience Revolution

Imagine a world where:
- **New developers are productive in minutes, not days** â€“ No more "it works on my machine" or lengthy environment setup
- **AI becomes your coding partner** â€“ Amazon Q Developer and Anthropic Claude Code provide intelligent code suggestions, reviews, and documentation
- **Security is built-in, not bolted-on** â€“ Centralized, compliant cloud development environments with audit trails
- **Resources scale automatically** â€“ Pay only for what you use with intelligent capacity management
- **Teams collaborate seamlessly** â€“ Shared cloud development environment templates ensure consistency across projects

This isn't a vision of the future â€“ it's what you'll build today.

## What Makes This Workshop Unique

**Real-World Impact**: Based on production deployments serving thousands of developers at enterprise scale

**AI-First Approach**: Deep integration with Amazon Q Developer and AWS Bedrock for intelligent development workflows

**Production-Ready Architecture**: Enterprise-grade security, scalability, and cost optimization built-in

**Hands-On Learning**: Deploy, configure, and use the platform â€“ not just theory

## Workshop Outcomes
