# Introduction

## Supercharge Developer Onboarding and Experience with Coder on AWS

In this workshop, you will learn how to standardize and scale development environments that eliminates "works on my machine" problems while supercharging productivity with AI-powered development tools on your existing AWS infrastructure.

### Key Learning Objectives (Duration 90 minutes)

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to demonstrate new skills in the following areas:

**Infrastructure & Platform Management:**
- Deploy and configure a production-ready Coder platform on Amazon EKS
- Understand the architecture patterns for scalable cloud development environments
- Implement secure, multi-tenant development infrastructure using AWS best practices

**Template Creation & Management:**
- Create persona-based Coder templates for different development environments (General/Linux, Serverless, AI-Assisted, Windows)
- Configure templates with pre-installed tools and dependencies
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) patterns for consistent workspace provisioning

**AI-Powered Development Workflows:**
- Integrate Amazon Q Developer for intelligent code assistance and generation
- Leverage AWS Bedrock with Anthropic Claude Code for advanced code review and documentation
- Create agentic development workflows that automate repetitive tasks

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- Onboard and shift developers in minutes instead of days
- Standardize development environments across teams
- Implement secure development practices with built-in compliance
- Scale development capacity dynamically based on project needs

## About Coder

Coder delivers self-hosted cloud development environments (CDE) that are provisioned as code and pre-deployed for developer activity on day one. Coder runs in your own cloud or even in air-gapped on-premises environments, giving developers access to powerful infrastructure without compromising governance. 


**Coder delivers:**
- **Improved Develeper Experience & Productivity**: Spin up fully configured environments in minutes without complex local setups
- **Secure & Reliable Environments**: Transition source code from laptops to your cloud for centralized control and governance
- **Agentics with trust at scale**: Leverage Amazon Q Developer and Anthropic Claude Code for intelligent code assistance
- **Compute Optimization**: Optimize spend by shutting down idle resources
- **VDI Alternative**: Replace slow and expensive legacy VDI with cloud workspaces 


## Target Audience

This workshop is designed for:
- **Platform Engineers** building developer experience platforms
- **DevOps / MLOps Engineers** implementing cloud-native development workflows  
- **Engineering Managers** seeking to improve team productivity
- **Developers** interested in AI-powered development environments
- **Solutions Architects** designing scalable development infrastructure

**Prerequisites:** 200-level AWS knowledge, basic Kubernetes understanding, familiarity with development workflows
