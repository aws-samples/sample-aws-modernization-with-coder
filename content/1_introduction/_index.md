# Introduction

## Supercharge Developer Experience and Productivity with Coder on AWS

Transform your development workflow by combining the power of AWS cloud infrastructure with Coder's Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) and cutting-edge AI capabilities. This workshop demonstrates how to create a modern, scalable development platform that eliminates "works on my machine" problems while supercharging productivity with AI-powered development tools.

### Key Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to demonstrate new skills in the following areas:

**Infrastructure & Platform Management:**
- Deploy and configure a production-ready Coder platform on Amazon EKS
- Understand the architecture patterns for scalable cloud development environments
- Implement secure, multi-tenant development infrastructure using AWS best practices

**Template Creation & Management:**
- Create persona-based Coder templates for different developer roles (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Data Science)
- Configure templates with pre-installed tools and dependencies
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) patterns for consistent workspace provisioning

**AI-Powered Development Workflows:**
- Integrate Amazon Q Developer for intelligent code assistance and generation
- Leverage AWS Bedrock with Anthropic Claude Code for advanced code review and documentation
- Create agentic development workflows that automate repetitive tasks
- Implement AI-powered code quality checks and security scanning

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- Onboard and shift developers in minutes instead of days
- Standardize development environments across teams
- Implement secure development practices with built-in compliance
- Scale development capacity dynamically based on project needs

## Workshop Value Proposition

This workshop addresses common developer experience challenges:

**Traditional Problems:**
- Hours spent on environment setup and configuration
- "Works on my machine" inconsistencies across team members
- Security risks originated from local development practices
- Difficulty scaling and troubleshooting development resources for growing teams
- Tool sprawl and scattered source code

**Coder delivers:**
- **Improved Develeper Experience & Productivity**: Spin up fully configured environments in minutes without complex local setups
- **Secure & Reliable Environments**: Transition source code from laptops to your cloud for centralized control and governance
- **Agentics with trust at scale**: Leverage Amazon Q Developer and Anthropic Claude Code for intelligent code assistance
- **Compute Optimization**: Optimize spend by shutting down idle resources
- **VDI Alternative**: Replace slow and expensive legacy VDI with cloud workspaces
