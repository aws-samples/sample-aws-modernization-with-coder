# Introduction

## Supercharge Developer Experience with Coder on AWS

Transform your development workflow by combining the power of AWS cloud infrastructure with Coder's Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) and cutting-edge AI capabilities. This workshop demonstrates how to create a modern, scalable development platform that eliminates "works on my machine" problems while supercharging productivity with AI-powered development tools.

### Key Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

**Infrastructure & Platform Management:**
- Deploy and configure a production-ready Coder platform on Amazon EKS
- Understand the architecture patterns for scalable cloud development environments
- Implement secure, multi-tenant development infrastructure using AWS best practices

**Template Creation & Management:**
- Create persona-based Coder templates for different developer roles (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Data Science)
- Configure templates with pre-installed tools, dependencies, and development environments
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) patterns for consistent workspace provisioning

**AI-Powered Development Workflows:**
- Integrate Amazon Q Developer for intelligent code assistance and generation
- Leverage AWS Bedrock with Claude for advanced code review and documentation
- Create agentic development workflows that automate repetitive tasks
- Implement AI-powered code quality checks and security scanning

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- Onboard new developers in minutes instead of days
- Enable consistent development environments across teams
- Implement secure development practices with built-in compliance
- Scale development capacity dynamically based on project needs

## Workshop Architecture & Value Proposition

This workshop addresses common developer experience challenges:

**Traditional Problems:**
- Hours spent on environment setup and configuration
- "Works on my machine" inconsistencies across team members
- Security vulnerabilities from local development practices
- Difficulty scaling development resources for growing teams
- Manual, repetitive development tasks consuming valuable time

**Our Solution:**
- **Instant Environment Provisioning**: Spin up fully configured development environments in under 2 minutes
- **AI-Enhanced Productivity**: Leverage Amazon Q Developer and Claude for intelligent code assistance
- **Enterprise Security**: Centralized, secure development with built-in compliance and audit trails
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for active development time with automatic resource scaling
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared templates and environments that ensure consistency
