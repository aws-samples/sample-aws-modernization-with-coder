# Coder Cloud Development Environments

## Transforming Development with Cloud-Native Environments

Coder delivers self-hosted Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) that revolutionize how development teams work. By moving development workloads from local machines to the cloud, Coder eliminates the friction of environment setup while providing enterprise-grade security, scalability, and cost optimization.

## What are Cloud Development Environments?

Cloud Development Environments are fully-configured, cloud-hosted development workspaces that developers can access from anywhere. Unlike traditional local development setups, CDEs provide:

- **Instant Environment Provisioning**: Spin up fully configured development environments in minutes, not hours or days
- **Consistent Development Experience**: Every developer works in identical, reproducible environments
- **Centralized Security & Governance**: Source code stays in your cloud infrastructure, not on individual laptops
- **Scalable Compute Resources**: Access powerful cloud resources on-demand without expensive local hardware
- **Seamless Collaboration**: Share environments, debug together, and maintain consistency across teams

## Key Learning Objectives (Duration 90 minutes)

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to demonstrate new skills in the following areas:

**Infrastructure & Platform Management: (30 min)**
- Deploy and configure a production-ready Coder platform on Amazon EKS
- Understand the architecture patterns for scalable cloud development environments
- Implement secure, multi-tenant development infrastructure using AWS best practices

**Template Creation & Management: (30 min)**
- Create persona-based Coder templates for different development environments (General/Linux, Serverless, AI-Assisted, Windows)
- Configure templates with pre-installed tools and dependencies
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) patterns for consistent workspace provisioning

**AI-Powered Development Workflows: (30 min)**
- Integrate Amazon Q Developer for intelligent code assistance and generation
- Leverage AWS Bedrock with Anthropic Claude Code for advanced code review and documentation
- Create agentic development workflows that automate repetitive tasks

**Real-World Use Cases:**
- Onboard developers in minutes instead of days
- Standardize development environments across teams
- Implement secure development practices with built-in compliance
- Scale development capacity dynamically based on project needs

## Who Should Attend

- **Platform Engineers** building developer experience platforms
- **DevOps Engineers** implementing cloud-native workflows
- **Engineering Managers** seeking to boost team productivity
- **Developers** interested in AI-enhanced development
- **Solutions Architects** designing scalable development infrastructure

**Prerequisites**: 200-level AWS knowledge, basic Kubernetes familiarity
