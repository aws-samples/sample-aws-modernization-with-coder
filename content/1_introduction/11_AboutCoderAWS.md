# Coder: Cloud Development Environments on AWS

![Partner Logo](/images/coder-logo-black.png)

## Why Coder on AWS?

Coder transforms how development teams work by delivering self-hosted Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) that leverage AWS's enterprise-grade infrastructure. By moving development workloads from local machines to AWS, organizations achieve unprecedented scalability, security, and cost efficiency.

## Core Value Propositions

Coder CDEs deliver three fundamental benefits: enhanced developer productivity, enterprise-grade security, and intelligent cost optimization.

- **Zero Setup Time**: Developers access fully-configured, AI-ready environments in under 2 minutes, eliminating "works on my machine" issues with standardized workspaces
- **Code Protection**: Source code never leaves your AWS infrastructure with built-in compliance, audit trails, and network isolation within your secure VPC
- **Auto-Scaling**: Environments automatically start/stop and right-size resources based on usage, reducing costs by up to 70% through efficient shared infrastructure

## AI-Driven Development Advantages

Coder enables four key AI-enhanced workflows: intelligent code generation, automated quality assurance, accelerated learning, and collaborative AI experiences.

- **Context-Aware AI**: Amazon Q Developer and AWS Bedrock models leverage full project context in standardized environments for scalable, relevant code suggestions
- **Automated Reviews**: AI agents provide automated code reviews, documentation generation, and security scanning integrated into development workflows
- **Personalized Guidance**: AI assistants deliver contextual help and pattern recognition to accelerate new developer learning and knowledge transfer
- **Shared AI Context**: Teams benefit from collective AI interactions with consistent behavior and secure processing within AWS infrastructure

## Real-World Impact

Organizations using Coder on AWS report:
- **90% faster** developer onboarding (minutes vs. days)
- **70% reduction** in development infrastructure costs
- **Zero security incidents** related to local development environments
- **50% increase** in developer satisfaction scores

**Why Cloud Development Environments Matter**: Leading technology companies like Anthropic, Netflix, Goldman Sachs, and Government/Intelligence Agencices have adopted CDEs to scale their development teams efficiently while maintaining security and consistency. This workshop shows you how to implement the same patterns in your organization.
